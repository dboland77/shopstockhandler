This is a demo application to load products from a retail API and allow the retailer to manage their stock with a few simple actions. 

The UI allows retailers to:
- monitor stock levels 
- See which items are on promotion
- See current price (and previous price if applicable)
- Select products
- Delete products


The project can be cloned from this repo and run with "yarn start" - to see testing run "yarn test"

A simple demo production version is deployed on Netlify at:
